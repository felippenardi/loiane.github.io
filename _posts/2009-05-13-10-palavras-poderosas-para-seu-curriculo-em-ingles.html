<p>No site do <a href="http://vyoms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vyoms</a>, saiu um artigo com uma lista de 10 palavras que fazem a diferença em seu currículo, e mostra a forma correta de usá-las.</p>
<p>Bem legal para quem tem um currículo em inglês ou está tentando uma vaga onde o inglês é necessário.</p>
<blockquote><p>The basic purpose of these words is to demonstrateyour hold of a particular situation and the actions you took to achieve a resultor come out of a situation. One important thing to note here is that theimmediate past tense of a verb is more powerful than the verb itself. Using apast tense also shows that you actually completed the work you startedsuccessfully. Adding some figures and facts along with these verbs would addmore impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vamos então à lista:</p>
<ol>
<li> <em><strong>Achieved</strong></em></li>
<p>Good example: Achieved the target of implementing the software onsite for 200 users 15 days before the deadline.</p>
<p>Bad example: To implement the software onsite.</p>
<p>This sounds more like a responsibility. The interviewer is mainly interested in knowing about your output.</p>
<li> <em><strong>Built</strong></em></li>
<p><em>Good Example:</em> Built new premises to convert the study centre into a residential college accommodating 200 students.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> Building a new premise for the residential college.</p>
<li><strong><em>Developed</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Developed guidelines for 50 users to understand and use the new process for client handling.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> Developing guidelines to use the new process for client handling.</p>
<p>The selector and the interviewer will be amused with questions like: What guidelines? When? For whom?. The good example here answers these queries and shows your output rather than your responsibility.</p>
<li><strong><em>Eliminated</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Eliminated the use of thick brown tape for sealing the packages to reduce the cost by over 15 per cent.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> To eliminate wasteful of resources.</p>
<p>The selector will again have the questions like 'what type of resources?', 'how did your action help?'</p>
<li><strong><em>Forecast</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Forecast a downturn in the FMCG business because of economic slowdown. Suggested measures to combat it and achieve the quarterly target.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> To analyse and forecast the market.</p>
<li><strong><em>Introduced</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Introduced a new process to handle queries from potential customers to increase the conversion rate by 60 per cent.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> Introducing a new process to handle client queries.</p>
<li><strong><em>Modernised</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Modernised a chain of 15 retail outlets across three states to meet the taste of urban youth.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> To modernise the look of retail chain outlets.</p>
<li><strong><em>Organised</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Organised reseller conferences in three cities while maintaining a close co-ordination with three internal departments and four vendors.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> Organising events like exhibitions and retailer conferences.</p>
<li><strong><em>Recommended</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Recommended five new ways to ensure that the company is able to roll out the new version of its 'small car' before the launch of Nano.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> Recommending ways for the company to roll out its new 'small car'</p>
<li><strong><em>Secured</em></strong></li>
<p><em>Good example:</em> Secured first position in the university while pursuing MBA course and helped the college stand at the top of the list.</p>
<p><em>Bad example:</em> University topper during MBA.</ol>
<p><strong><em>How do I use these in my CV?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>1. List your responsibilities and achievements.<br />
2. Find the one word that best describes your role in that situation such as manage, co-ordinate, plan, advise etc.<br />
3. Begin your sentence with the past tense of the verb you decide to use for every responsibility.<br />
4. Add some figures and facts to your statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Até a próxima!</p>
